We outline the mathematical structure and computational methods for European and American options under both the Heston and Merton jump-diffusion models, including the calculation of Greeks and barrier options.\n1. Introduction to Stochastic Option Pricing Stochastic models are essential for capturing the randomness in financial markets, especially for pricing derivatives like options. Two widely used models are:\nHeston Model: Incorporates stochastic volatility, allowing volatility to evolve randomly over time. Merton Jump Diffusion Model: Extends the Black-Scholes framework by adding random jumps in asset prices, capturing sudden market moves. 2. Heston Model The Heston model describes the evolution of an asset price $S_t$ and its variance $v_t$ as:\n\\begin{equation*} dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sqrt{v_t}\\ S_t\\ dW_t^S \\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*} dv_t = \\kappa (\\theta - v_t) dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{v_t}\\ dW_t^v \\end{equation*}\nwhere $dW_t^S$ and $dW_t^v$ are correlated Brownian motions.\n\\begin{equation*} dW_t^S dW_t^v = \\rho dt \\end{equation*}\nSimulation of the Heston model involves generating correlated random walks for price and variance, and pricing options via Monte Carlo and Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) methods. LSMC is used for American options, regressing future payoffs to estimate optimal early exercise.\nIn the Heston model, the two Brownian motions $dW_t^S$ and $dW_t^v$ are correlated with correlation coefficient $\\rho$. To simulate these correlated processes using independent standard normal variables, we use the Cholesky decomposition.\nLet $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ be independent standard normal random variables. The correlated Brownian increments can be constructed as:\n\\begin{equation*} dW_t^S = \\sqrt{dt}\\ Z_1 \\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*} dW_t^v = \\rho \\sqrt{dt}\\ Z_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}\\ \\sqrt{dt}\\ Z_2 \\end{equation*}\nThis transformation ensures that $dW_t^S$ and $dW_t^v$ have the desired correlation $\\rho$.\nThe Cholesky decomposition is used to decompose the covariance matrix of the Brownian motions, allowing us to generate correlated random variables from independent ones. For a $2 \\times 2$ covariance matrix:\n$$ \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; \\rho \\ \\rho \u0026amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Cholesky factor $L$ is:\n$$ L = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \\ \\rho \u0026amp; \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nGiven $\\mathbf{Z} = (Z_1, Z_2)^T$, the correlated increments are $L \\mathbf{Z}$.\nFor a detailed explanation see this video on the Heston model.\n3. Merton Jump Diffusion Model The Merton model modifies the standard geometric Brownian motion by adding jumps:\n\\begin{equation*} dS_t = (r - r_j) S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dZ_t + J_t S_t dN_t \\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*} S_= S_{t-1} \\left( e^{\\left(r-r_j-\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)dt + \\sigma \\sqrt{dt} z_t^1}+ \\left(e^{\\mu_j+\\delta z_t^2}-1 \\right) y_t \\right) \\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*} r_j = \\lambda \\left(e^{\\mu_j+\\frac{\\delta^2}{2}}\\right)-1 \\end{equation*}\nwhere $dN_t$ is a Poisson process representing jumps, and $J_t$ is the jump size. Simulation under this model involves generating asset paths with both continuous and jump components, and pricing options by averaging discounted payoffs.\n4. Greeks Calculation The Greeks measure sensitivities of option prices to various parameters. In this framework, Delta and Gamma are computed using finite difference methods:\nDelta: Sensitivity to underlying price. Gamma: Sensitivity of Delta to underlying price. Finite difference approximations are used to estimate these derivatives numerically.\n5. Barrier Options Barrier options are path-dependent derivatives that only pay off if the underlying asset crosses a certain barrier. The framework includes methods for pricing up-and-in and down-and-in options under both the Heston and Merton models, using Monte Carlo simulation to determine whether the barrier is breached and to compute the discounted payoff accordingly.\n6. Conclusion This theoretical overview provides the mathematical and computational foundation for advanced option pricing models, including simulation, pricing, and risk analysis. The methods described here are applicable to a wide range of financial derivatives and serve as a reference for both theory and practical implementation.\nRead more →\n","date":1746835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1747775794,"objectID":"4467d7575e722a4cd39e9d0c9feb00d2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site/post/2025/05/10/stochastic-pricing-models/","publishdate":"2025-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/site/post/2025/05/10/stochastic-pricing-models/","section":"post","summary":"This article provides an exposition of stochastic models for option pricing, focusing on the mathematical formulation and computational techniques underlying the Heston and Merton jump-diffusion frameworks.

The system consists of four main components:\nData Pipeline Feature Store Backend/Inference Frontend The system is composed of two main platforms: one dedicated to handling data and the other focused on inference and user interaction. This design offers a modular and flexible architecture, ensuring seamless integration between components. A scheduler is used to initiate the pipeline and perform batch training processes.\nData Pipeline The data pipeline manages feature engineering and data science tasks using Kedro, which applies software engineering principles to data science projects. This approach eliminates disorganised notebooks and ensures maintainability and production-grade quality.\nDask enables distributed processing across a cluster, making the pipeline efficient for handling large multidimensional image arrays and parallel I/O operations.\nModel Architecture The system uses the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for embedding, which maps both images and text into a shared embedding space. CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and supports zero-shot prediction.\nFor efficient similarity searches, the system employs Faiss, which offers:\nFast retrieval by storing indices in memory Minimal memory footprint to keep operational costs low GPU acceleration and parallel processing capabilities Balance between speed and accuracy The current implementation uses a flat index suitable for small-scale searches (1,000-10,000 entries), but can easily transition to larger-scale index types if needed.\nWe further add an image captioning model to generate text from the given retrieved images.\nFeature Store The feature store houses images, embeddings, and image byte data, enabling data science teams to reuse this information without repeating EDA, feature engineering, or modeling tasks. This promotes efficiency and cost savings. Feast is used for the feature store, which provides:\nThe feature store houses images, embeddings, and image byte data using Feast, which provides:\nAn offline store (Parquet files) designed for efficient data storage and quick data access An online store (SQLite) optimised for fast inference Reusability of data without repeating EDA, feature engineering, or modeling tasks Model Registry The system uses a local file system as storage for models, mimicking a typical model registry. Models can be tested and approved for production readiness, with the potential to configure Kedro using MLflow for model management. We use DVC for data and model tracking.\nBackend The backend features an API for inference built with FastAPI, including:\nBasic schema validation for incoming requests In-memory model loading for quick response times Multi-model serving capabilities Resource optimization by loading/unloading models between RAM and disk Frontend The frontend is designed to minimize redundant backend calls by storing search results in the browser’s local storage. If a user searches for fewer than k results for the same query, the system retrieves them from memory instead of making additional backend requests.\nThe entire system can be easily deployed and containerised using existing Docker files.\nView project →\n","date":1744070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1747689373,"objectID":"7e09a79a2e2febbe4c21922380e411fe","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site/post/2025/04/08/image-retrieval/","publishdate":"2025-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/site/post/2025/04/08/image-retrieval/","section":"post","summary":"A comprehensive guide to building a modular image retrieval system with CLIP embeddings and Faiss.

The first model we consider is the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Model which is risk neutral under Martingale measure $\\mathbb{Q}$.

This means the process is path unbiased.\nAccording to this model the stock at time $t$ can move to up by a factor of $u$ with probability $p$ and down by a factor of $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ at the next time step $t+1$. Using the principle of no arbitrage, the stock earns a risk free interest ($r$) and parameters $d \u0026lt; 1 \u0026lt; u$. The risk neutral probability $p$ is then given by mean matching.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[S_{t+\\Delta t}] \u0026amp;= S_0e^{r\\Delta t} \\\\ S_0e^{r\\Delta t} \u0026amp;= S_0u\\cdot p+S_0d\\cdot(1-p) \\\\ \\implies p \u0026amp;= \\frac{e^{r\\Delta t}-d}{u-d} \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\nSimilarly the call option $c_0 = e^{-rT}(c_u\\cdot p+c_d\\cdot(1-p))$.

No cash injection or deposits are allowed once the portfolio has been created, portfolio rebalancing is funded using assets within the portfolio. This is referred to as a self financing portfolio.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{t,u} \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 u - c_u \\quad \\text{upward movement} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{t,d} \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 d - c_d \\quad \\text{downward movement} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\nRebalancing under this constraints leads to delta hedging.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Delta S_0 d - c_d \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 u - c_u \\\\ \\Delta \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_u-c_d}{S_0 u - S_0 d} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n$\\Delta$ is the amount of the underlying that we must own for the portfolio to be risk neutral.\nAmerican Binomial Tree The American binomial tree extends the standard binomial model to handle early exercise options. At each node, we compare the immediate exercise value with the discounted expected future value to determine the optimal exercise strategy.\nTrinomial Tree The trinomial tree model extends the binomial model by allowing for an additional middle state. This provides more flexibility in modeling the underlying price process and can lead to faster convergence compared to binomial trees.\nAsian Binomial Tree The Asian binomial tree model is used for pricing Asian options where the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over some time period. The model tracks the average price along each path and computes the option value accordingly.\nRead more →\n","date":1740873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743973063,"objectID":"67693b42a18cb945f54575296c49b45a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site/post/2025/03/02/lattice-pricing-models/","publishdate":"2025-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/site/post/2025/03/02/lattice-pricing-models/","section":"post","summary":"Implementation of binomial and trinomial lattice models for pricing options, including European, American, and Asian options with delta hedging strategies.","tags":["Derivatives"],"title":"Lattice Pricing Models","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Derivatives"],"content":"The put-call parity (PCP) establishes the relationship between call and put options that share the same underlying asset and expiration date.
