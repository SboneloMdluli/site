The system consists of four main components:\nData Pipeline Feature Store Backend/Inference Frontend The system is composed of two main platforms: one dedicated to handling data and the other focused on inference and user interaction. This design offers a modular and flexible architecture, ensuring seamless integration between components. A scheduler is used to initiate the pipeline and perform batch training processes.\nData Pipeline The data pipeline manages feature engineering and data science tasks using Kedro, which applies software engineering principles to data science projects. This approach eliminates disorganised notebooks and ensures maintainability and production-grade quality.\nDask enables distributed processing across a cluster, making the pipeline efficient for handling large multidimensional image arrays and parallel I/O operations.\nModel Architecture The system uses the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for embedding, which maps both images and text into a shared embedding space. CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and supports zero-shot prediction.\nFor efficient similarity searches, the system employs Faiss, which offers:\nFast retrieval by storing indices in memory Minimal memory footprint to keep operational costs low GPU acceleration and parallel processing capabilities Balance between speed and accuracy The current implementation uses a flat index suitable for small-scale searches (1,000-10,000 entries), but can easily transition to larger-scale index types if needed.\nFeature Store The feature store houses images, embeddings, and image byte data, enabling data science teams to reuse this information without repeating EDA, feature engineering, or modeling tasks. This promotes efficiency and cost savings. Feast is used for the feature store, which provides:\nThe feature store houses images, embeddings, and image byte data using Feast, which provides:\nAn offline store (Parquet files) designed for efficient data storage and quick data access An online store (SQLite) optimised for fast inference Reusability of data without repeating EDA, feature engineering, or modeling tasks Model Registry The system uses a local file system as storage for models, mimicking a typical model registry. Models can be tested and approved for production readiness, with the potential to configure Kedro using MLflow for model management. We use DVC for data and model tracking.\nBackend The backend features an API for inference built with FastAPI, including:\nBasic schema validation for incoming requests In-memory model loading for quick response times Multi-model serving capabilities Resource optimization by loading/unloading models between RAM and disk Frontend The frontend is designed to minimize redundant backend calls by storing search results in the browser’s local storage. If a user searches for fewer than k results for the same query, the system retrieves them from memory instead of making additional backend requests.\nThe entire system can be easily deployed and containerised using existing Docker files.\nExtended System for Accessibility The design can be adapted to assist visually impaired users by:\nIntegrating speech-to-text directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js or ONNX Runtime Web Providing text descriptions of images instead of visual results Using text-to-speech engines running in the browser Leveraging geolocation to select appropriate voice accents User feedback can be collected through simple thumbs up/down emoticons.\nView project →\n","date":1741564800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743720371,"objectID":"7e09a79a2e2febbe4c21922380e411fe","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site/post/2025/03/10/image-retrieval/","publishdate":"2025-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/site/post/2025/03/10/image-retrieval/","section":"post","summary":"A comprehensive guide to building a modular image retrieval system with CLIP embeddings and Faiss.

The first model we consider is the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Model which is risk neutral under Martingale measure $\\mathbb{Q}$. A process $S$ is a Martingale with respect to measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ and filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$, if $ \\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s] = X_s \\quad \\forall , s\\leq t$. This means the process is path unbiased.\nAccording to this model the stock at time $t$ can move to up by a factor of $u$ with probability $p$ and down by a factor of $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ at the next time step $t+1$. Using the principle of no arbitrage, the stock earns a risk free interest ($r$) and parameters $d \u0026lt; 1 \u0026lt; u$. The risk neutral probability $p$ is then given by mean matching.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}[S_{t+\\Delta t}] \u0026amp;= S_0e^{r\\Delta t} \\\\ S_0e^{r\\Delta t} \u0026amp;= S_0u\\cdot p+S_0d\\cdot(1-p) \\\\ \\implies p \u0026amp;= \\frac{e^{r\\Delta t}-d}{u-d} \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\nSimilarly the call option $c_0 = e^{-rT}(c_u\\cdot p+c_d\\cdot(1-p))$. We can evaluate $u$ and $d$ by matching the variance.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{V}(S _{t+\\Delta t}) \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E}[(S_{t+\\Delta t})^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[S_{t+\\Delta t}])^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2 \\Delta t \u0026amp;= p \\cdot u^2 + d^2(1-p) + (p \\cdot u^2 + d^2(1-p))^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2 \\Delta t \u0026amp;= (p -p^2)(u-d)^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2 \\Delta t \u0026amp;= e^{r\\Delta t} (u+d) - u \\cdot d - e^{2r\\Delta t} \\\\ \\sigma^2 \\Delta t \u0026amp;= e^{r\\Delta t} (u+1/u) - u \\cdot 1/u - e^{2r\\Delta t} \\quad \\text{[$u\\cdot d=1$ ]} \\\\ u \u0026amp;= e^{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}} \\\\ d \u0026amp;= e^{-\\sigma \\sqrt{\\Delta t}} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\nThe above definitions rely on a sufficiently small $\\Delta t$ for $p$ to be a valid probability.\nDelta Hedging We define a portfolio $\\Pi_{t}$, under the principle of no arbitrage the portfolio is worth the same at time $t$ regardless of the path taken to $t+1$. No cash injection or deposits are allowed once the portfolio has been created, portfolio rebalancing is funded using assets within the portfolio. This is referred to as a self financing portfolio.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{t,u} \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 u - c_u \\quad \\text{upward movement} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Pi_{t,d} \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 d - c_d \\quad \\text{downward movement} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\nRebalancing under this constraints leads to delta hedging.\n\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\Delta S_0 d - c_d \u0026amp;= \\Delta S_0 u - c_u \\\\ \\Delta \u0026amp;= \\frac{c_u-c_d}{S_0 u - S_0 d} \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\n$\\Delta$ is the amount of the underlying that we must own for the portfolio to be risk neutral.\nAmerican Binomial Tree The American binomial tree extends the standard binomial model to handle early exercise options. At each node, we compare the immediate exercise value with the discounted expected future value to determine the optimal exercise strategy.\nTrinomial Tree The trinomial tree model extends the binomial model by allowing for an additional middle state. This provides more flexibility in modeling the underlying price process and can lead to faster convergence compared to binomial trees.\nAsian Binomial Tree The Asian binomial tree model is used for pricing Asian options where the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over some time period. The model tracks the average price along each path and computes the option value accordingly.\nRead more →\n","date":1740873600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743721512,"objectID":"67693b42a18cb945f54575296c49b45a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/site/post/2025/03/02/lattice-pricing-models/","publishdate":"2025-03-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/site/post/2025/03/02/lattice-pricing-models/","section":"post","summary":"Implementation of binomial and trinomial lattice models for pricing options, including European, American, and Asian options with delta hedging strategies.","tags":["Derivatives"],"title":"Lattice Pricing Models","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Derivatives"],"content":"The put-call parity (PCP) establishes the relationship between call and put options that share the same underlying asset and expiration date.

However, VaR has limitations, such as not considering tail dependency and lacking sub-additivity. Expected Shortfall (ES): An improvement over VaR, ES is a coherent risk measure that calculates the average loss in scenarios where losses exceed VaR. It satisfies properties like monotonicity and sub-additivity. Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES): Measures the contribution of a single institution to the overall systemic risk, calculated as the expected loss of an institution conditional on the system’s loss exceeding VaR. Capital Shortfall (CS): The amount by which an institution’s capital falls short during a crisis. It is influenced by factors like leverage, size, and risk exposure. Long Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES): An extension of MES over a longer horizon, estimating the expected loss of an institution during a market crash.
