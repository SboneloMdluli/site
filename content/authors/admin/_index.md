I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer with expertise in machine learning, quantitative modeling and software engineering. My strong quantitative and analytical skills are rooted in a background in Electrical and Information Engineering, complemented by an MSc in Financial Engineering. I specialize in developing production machine learning solutions, constructing efficient data pipelines, and deploying robust inference systems that consistently deliver measurable outcomes using MLOps best practises. My experience spans from modelling to developing software consuming produced models.
